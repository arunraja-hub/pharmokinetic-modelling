## :pill: Pharmokinetic Modelling
This pharmokinetic model describes the concentration of a drug in a patient. This model includes the delivery, diffusion and clearance of the drug in the patient. The patient will be modelled as a central compartment into which the drug is administered and from which it is excreted. One or two peripheral compartements can be added by the user. The drug can be distributed to these peripheral compartments and from these compartments back to the central compartment. The dynamics of the drug are modelled by zeroth-order and first-order rate equations.
